This code book is for the TidyData file resulting from the code in run_analysis.R, submitted by user 8wonfioubqwei6 for Coursera getdata-011.

The TidyData file contains mean values for selected measurements from the data compiled by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones project. A full description of the underlying data is at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones (HARUS), the data can be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .

The source (HARUS) data consists of a set of observations from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung mobile phone.  30 subjects were recorded multiple times while participating in 6 different activities.  Of the 30, 70% were recorded during the train part of the project, and 30% were recorded during the test part of the project.  In total, there were 561 separate observations per subject record. 

The TidyData set was created from the HARUS data by the following steps:

First, the files with data were read into R.  Then the observation data for the training and testing phases were combined, and column names were added accordingly.  At this point, the number of columns was reduced to target data, which included only mean and standard deviation observation recordings.  This resulted in 86 remaining columns.  Next, subject and activity identifiers were matched to each other, and the activity identifiers were converted to descriptions.  The subjects, activities, and observations were joined in one large data set.  A function was then performed to calculate and record the mean for every type of observation by subject and activity.

The column names are directly taken from the underlying data. The complete list of columns in the resulting TidyData table are:
